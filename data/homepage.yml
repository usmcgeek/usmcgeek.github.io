        How weird?
        Aliens weird!
        Zombies weird!
        Cultists summoning monsters weird!
        
        Stir it all into a pot and add a dash of futuristic weaponry.

        It’s 1947, and four years after Hitler’s assassination by his own forces in 1943,
        the War still rages on - powered by technology recovered from a crashed UFO
        discovered in Antarctica. Alien VK tech allows for walking tanks, a
        zombie-resurrection serum, uplifted battle-apes, lasers, phasers, and jetpacks.
        The forces which secure the most VK will finally end the war, victorious and unstoppable.

        A fast-paced, easy to learn (and teach) turn-based tactical miniatures game,
        with incredibly detailed models of weapons and heroes, vehicles and terrain.
        Each unit is accompanied by a stats card detailing range, movement, flexibility,
        and impact on different classes of armoured opponent. Your talent as a commander
        combines with the luck of the dice to determine victory for some – and a tactical retreat for others.

March: To make up for the huge number of casualties among Axis forces, the Blutkreuz Korps starts testing the Wiederbelebungsserum on fallen German soldiers. The experiment looks promising.

April: Adolf Hitler organizes a victory parade in Berlin for his birthday and to celebrate taking Stalingrad. During the parade, Hitler is assassinated. A few well informed people connect the killing to the Blutkreuz Korps but find no culprits.

Further research of this type is completely banned by the Axis amid fears of causing catastrophic damage to the Earth’s crust.

July: From Ceylon, Japanese forces threaten the supply lines of all Allied armies in Southeast Asia. The USA decides to use a VK-enhanced nuclear bomb on the island before attacking it. The result is beyond their imagination; the whole island is wiped out by the blast. The earth cracks and the ocean swallows 90% of the land.

The Allies ban any further use of nuclear weapons.
